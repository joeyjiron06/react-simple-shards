# React Simple Shards

## Why this project?

Sometimes you just need a very simple html with a little javascript but don't need all the lirbaries with hot-reloading, a million npm dependencies that come with react starter projects.

This project is meant to be a starter template for building very small lightweight webpages with a few different routes at the most using [Shards React](https://designrevision.com/downloads/shards-react/) as the component library. If you need to build a big application with hundreds of files, then this repo is not for you, use something like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) instead. 

I use [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) and [babel-standalone](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone) to load all the needed external dependencies so there is no build system! That means you have to load all your new javascript files at the bottom of index.html.
